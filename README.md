# long_read_polyATGC_trimmer
A regular expression based polyATGC trimmer from the long reads or the fastq reads extremely fast and returns a fasta and also a dataframe for the sequence classification and this takes the current as 10 continuous bases (you can change the number in the regular expression and i am releasing a new code which checks all of them) and i timeit and instead of pandas, if you use modin pandas as pd for multicore processing, it parses the GBs of long read file in less than few minutes. ðŸ˜€ It also returns where the stretch was and how many iterations are needed. A sample on how to run the code is given below. if you are using the long reads for machine learning then it directly returns a dataframe for ingestion to machine leaning.
